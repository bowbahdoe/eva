;; ^^^^^ sym->edb ^^^^^^
;; Data sources are passed around as symbols in the datalog engine. sym->edb is used
;; to resolve the symbol to a specific Extensional database.
;;
;; When the query is compiled to Datalog, it wraps all the Extensional
;; sources with a single Extensional object with an extra ?src-var term; this object
;; then dispatches based on the value of that ?src-var.
;;
;; But if a data source is passed to a function, the function expects to see an actual
;; data source, not symbol. Because data sources are not actually available until
;; the inputs are passed into the query, and because we support arbitrary functions,
;; and because of *details*, it is easier to have the sym->edb map available at query
;; runtime than it is to wrap the functions correctly at compile time.
